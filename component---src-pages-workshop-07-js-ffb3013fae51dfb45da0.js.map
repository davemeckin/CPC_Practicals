design some simple interactions with 3D objects to produce a little DJ web toy. So, we will:</p>\n\t<p>\n     <ul>\n\t\t  <li>Work from starter code provided that you will fork a new codesandbox from. This is because, to demonstrate the concepts, we've scaffolding your learning a bit for this week's challenge. </li>\n\t\t  <li>Take a little look at Quaternions as a method for rotating objects in space.</li>\n\t\t  <li>Have a quick raycasting demonstration</li>\n\t\t  <li>Challenge you a bit more to think about what's going on in the code by describing to what <strong>should</strong> happen; getting you to have a go at programming it yourself; then allowing you to see our solutions.</li>\n\t\t  <li>Use raycasting, event listeners and some fun Tone js features to create our dj turntable and mixer interface</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</p>\n\n\t<p>Here's what we're going to be building (mouse over; click and drag on the deck to see what happens. Also mouse over; click and drag on the cross fader of the mixer):</p>\n\n\n  <iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/turntablesend-qbrd7?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&view=preview\"\n     style={{width:'100%', height:'500px', border:'0', overflow:'hidden'}}\n     title=\"TurntablesEnd\"\n     allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n     sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"\n   ></iframe>\n\t\n   <p>We've purposefully left the visual design as grey here as this is something that you can customise as you go.

We know this is tempting, but the point of a university education is for you to learn the necessary skills for your field, and copying and pasting code will not be on any job descriptions.</strong>\n\t</p>\n    \n\n    <h2>Task 1 - Rotating Using Quaternions: A Quick Example</h2>\n    <p>\n    <p>Before we go on to making the actual thing though, let's just take a quick look at a couple of concepts that we talked about in the lecture. First of all, rotation using Quaternions. Now, as we said, you don't need to understand the complex maths involved to use quaternions as Mr Doob (Three js author) has kindly wrapped up that functionality for us.</p>\n \n \t<p>Take a look at the example below and use the arrow keys to rotate the cube:</p>\n\n <iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/w04t01-5em5e?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark\"\n     style={{width:'100%', height:'500px', border:'0', overflow:'hidden'}}\n     title=\"W04_T01\"\n     allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n     sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"\n   ></iframe>\n   <p></p>\n\n\t</p>\n\n\n   \t<p>Now, this may not seem all that exciting right now, but think of the possibilities you have of rotating all kinds of objects, or arrays of objects, or arrays of arrays of objects like last workshop! To achieve this functionality we've done a couple of things</p>\n\t\n\t <Accordion allowZeroExpanded = \"true\">\n\t <AccordionItem>\n                <AccordionItemHeading>\n                    <AccordionItemButton>\n                        First, at the top of our index.js before the init() function, we define a JS object that links quaternion rotations to arrow keys\n                    </AccordionItemButton>\n                </AccordionItemHeading>\n                <AccordionItemPanel>\n                    <p>\n                         <code>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<CodeBlock text = {`const ANGULAR_SPEED = 0.5;\nconst MOVEMENTS = {\n  ArrowUp: new THREE.Quaternion().setFromAxisAngle( //create a new quaternion and call the set from axis angle method\n    new THREE.Vector3(1, 0, 0), //create a new vector which will rotate around the X axis\n    THREE.MathUtils.degToRad(ANGULAR_SPEED * 6) //convert degrees to radians for our rotation amount in the positive direction\n  ),\n  ArrowDown: new THREE.Quaternion().setFromAxisAngle(\n    new THREE.Vector3(1, 0, 0), //create a new vector which will rotate around the X axis\n    THREE.MathUtils.degToRad(-ANGULAR_SPEED * 6) //convert degrees to radians for our rotation amount in the negative direction\n  ),\n  ArrowLeft: new THREE.Quaternion().setFromAxisAngle(\n    new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0), //create a new vector which will rotate around the Y axis\n    THREE.MathUtils.degToRad(-ANGULAR_SPEED * 6) //convert degrees to radians for our rotation amount in the negative direction\n  ),\n  ArrowRight: new THREE.Quaternion().setFromAxisAngle(\n    new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0), //create a new vector which will rotate around the Y axis\n    THREE.MathUtils.degToRad(ANGULAR_SPEED * 6) //convert degrees to radians for our rotation amount in the positive direction\n  )\n};`} language = {\"javascript\"} theme = {dracula} showLineNumbers = {false} class = \"codeBlocks\" />\n\n    \n\t\t\t\t   \t\t</code>\n\t\t\t\t\n                    </p>\n                    <p></p>\n                </AccordionItemPanel>\n            </AccordionItem>\n            <AccordionItem>\n                <AccordionItemHeading>\n                    <AccordionItemButton>\n                        Then, using the arrow keys object and Three js quaternions object, rotate our cube\n                    </AccordionItemButton>\n                </AccordionItemHeading>\n                <AccordionItemPanel>\n                    <p>\n                         <code>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<CodeBlock text = {`document.addEventListener(\"keydown\", onDocumentKeyDown, false);\n\nfunction onDocumentKeyDown(event) {\n\tevent.preventDefault(); // stop scrolling the page using the arrow keys\n  if (MOVEMENTS[event.key]) {\n    const cur = cube.quaternion; // store our current quaternion in a variable\n    const rot = MOVEMENTS[event.key]; // get our next rotation value from the JS object corresponding to the key that was pressed\n    cur.multiplyQuaternions(rot, cur); // multiplyQuaternions with current and next to perform the rotation\n  }\n}`} language = {\"javascript\"} theme = {dracula} showLineNumbers = {false} class = \"codeBlocks\" />\n\n    \n\t\t\t\t   \t\t</code>\n\t\t\t\t\n                    </p>\n                </AccordionItemPanel>\n            </AccordionItem>\n            \n      </Accordion>\n    \n  \n   <p>While we're not actually going to use quaternions in our DJ webtoy, we feel it is very important that you have this example to work from if you do end up wanting to rotate objects using this method in your own projects later!</p>\n    \n    <h2>Task 2 - Raycasting: A Quick Example</h2>\n\n    <p>Another key concept, along with rotation, is raycasting. As we discussed in the lecture, this is a common method used in 3D interaction to see whether our cursor is hovering over something that we might want to interact with. So, imagine a ray being cast from the camera to the mouse cursor and then through any other objects in the scene that follow after that.</p>\n\n\n   <p>Take a look at the simple example below. You can see that when the mouse hovers over the cube, it turns red. Also take a look at the JS console in this example. We are printing an array that is being maintained by the raycaster object. Whent the mouse isn't over anything, the array is empty. But when the mouse casts a ray through the cube object, you can see the array is updated:</p>\n  <iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/w04t02-yrqvg?expanddevtools=1&fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark\"\n     style={{width:'100%', height:'500px', border:'0', overflow:'hidden'}}\n     title=\"W04_T02\"\n     allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n     sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"\n   ></iframe>\n   <p></p>\n\n   \n\n   <p>Take a moment to look at the update function in index.js and understand what is going on here. It's important as we're going to use this quite a lot in our DJ example.</p>\n    \n\n    \n\n     \n    <p></p>\n\n    \n\n\t\n\n\t<p></p>\n\n    <h2>Task 3 - DJ Sprinkles Part 1</h2>\n\n    <h5>Work from the starter project provided here and fork it to begin work in codesandbox:</h5>\n\n    <p></p>\n      <iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/w04t03starter-opv39?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark\"\n     style={{width:'100%', height:'500px', border:'0', overflow:'hidden'}}\n     title=\"W04_T03_STARTER\"\n     allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n     sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"\n   ></iframe>\n\n   <p></p>\n\n    \n\n    <p></p>\n  \n    \n\n    <p>As you can see, this is a considerably more complex project already, despite it looking so simple!</p>\n\n    <p>Take a look around - open the djObjects.js file too and have a look in there. You can see that we've made a different javascript file and defined some classes in there that we are then exporting. We import them in index.js and that means we can use them just like we used the walker and mover classes in the previous weeks. This way of doing things just means we can break up our code into easier to read files that aren't millions of lines long.\n\n    We're still just drawing some primative geometries but this time we're using the extrude functionality to make a cylinder that will represent our DJ turntable's platter.</p>\n\n    <p>It's also very important to note that we have used some of the key principles of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) here. We've modelled our functionality on real world objects by breaking our various graphical elements up in to their component parts.\n    But perhaps more importantly, we're using the <code> extends </code> keyword so that some of our objects actually inherit lots of functionlity from the THREE.Mesh object (and later the THREE.Object3D object). This is useful as we can than customise our objects while maintaining all the great stuff meshes (and Object3D's) can do.</p>\n\n     <p>We're using a different rotation method here too: the bounding box instead of quaternions as we're actually only rotating our turntable platter around one axis. </p>\n\n\t<p>It's also worth noting that we have already added the event listeners needed as well as some slightly hack-y code for translating mouse movement into something useful for our purposes.</p>\t\n  \n  <p>Right, now we've covered what's there, we need to think about what it is we need to do in order to make our webtoy functional.</p>\n\n\n    <p>Let's break down our desired functionality for this first bit, we need to:</p>\n\n   <ul>\n    \t<li>Play an audio file</li>\n    \t<li>Create and update our Turntable so that it keeps spinning to keep the party going...</li>\n    \t<li>Add a texture onto our turntable so that we can see it rotating (and make it look more like a record)</li>\n    \n    </ul>\n\n    <p>OK, let's start coding. We're going to start in our init() function, just beneath the line where we add the event listeners (there are some comments in there to help you find the right section).</p>\n\n    <p>Let's add our Tone crossfader and audio file player. We've already added a silly tune for you to use but you're more than welcome to use your own. So, first we make the crossfader and connect that to our master output.\n    Then we make our Tone player and specify that once it has loaded the file, loop it and automatically start playing it:</p>\n\n    <code>\n\t<CodeBlock text = {`crossFade = new Tone.CrossFade().toDestination(); // create a new Tone crossfader and connect it to the master output\n  player1 = new Tone.Player(\"./sounds/Warrpy.mp3\", () => { //make a new Tone audio file player with callback function to execute once the file has loaded\n    player1.loop = true; // loop our audio for continuous playback\n    player1.autostart = true; // play audio automatically\n  }).connect(crossFade.a); // connect the player to the input a of the cross fader`} language = {\"javascript\"} theme = {dracula} showLineNumbers = {false} class = \"codeBlocks\" />\n\n    \n\t</code>\n\n\t<p>Now we have sound, but we can't see anything. </p>\n\n\t<p>Just below where we created our audio stuff in the init() function, let's make a new turntable object at a position that is left a bit on the x axis and add it to our scene:</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t   \t\t<code>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<CodeBlock text = {` turntable1 = new Turntable(new THREE.Vector3(-60, 0, 0), \"platter1\"); // create a new turntable \n  scene.add(turntable1); //add the turntable to our scene`} language = {\"javascript\"} theme = {dracula} showLineNumbers = {false} class = \"codeBlocks\" />\n\n    \n\t\t\t\t   \t\t</code>\n\t<p>Now we need to update our turntable to keep it spinning, so let's go ahead and add the call to update in our time dependent section of our main update function (this is labelled in the comments of the code):</p>\n\t<p>At the moment we're just going to pass an empty array as the third argument, but later on we will change this so that it will the array of objects in the line of sight of the raycaster...</p>\n\t   \t\t\n\t\t\t\t   \t\t<code>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<CodeBlock text = {` turntable1.update(clicked, mouse.y, [], player1); // update our turntable`} language = {\"javascript\"} theme = {dracula} showLineNumbers = {false} class = \"codeBlocks\" />\n\n    \n\t\t\t\t   \t\t</code>\n              \n     \n    <p>Cool, we should now be able see our deck, but it's difficult to actually tell that the platter is spinning right? So let's go ahead and add a texture to our platter.</p>\n    <p>We've taken the liberty of adding an image that we can use as a texture in the images folder. </p>\n     <p>Open the djObjects.js file again and head to the constructor of the platter object.

We've set the \"recursive\" flag on the intersectObjects method to true here, because our platter is actually contained within the turntable object and that is really the thing we're interested in manipulating.</p>\n     <code>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<CodeBlock text = {`\nraycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera); // calculate objects intersecting the picking ray\nlet intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true); // create a new array that will hold any objects within the scene that the ray hits`} language = {\"javascript\"} theme = {dracula} showLineNumbers = {false} class = \"codeBlocks\" />\n\n    \n\t\t\t\t   \t\t</code>\n               <p></p>\n\t<p>\n    Just below that, let's change the call to turntable's update method so that we now pass in the intersects array, instead of the empty one we were passing in before. Can you think what we need to change?

So let's talk through what we need to do in the update function of our turntable:</p>\n    <ul>\n    \t<li>We're going to check whether the intersects array is greater than 0 i.e is our mouse casting a ray over any object in our scene</li>\n    \t<li>Then, in a nested if statement, we're going to check whether the first object in the array (the closest object) matches the name of our object</li>\n    \t<li>We want to change colour of our object if it the name does match, so we'll add a bit of logic in there for that</li>\n    \t\n    </ul>\n    <p>Have a go at trying to code this yourself.

Make sure you start as you mean to go on and make a folder for this module, then another folder inside that one called \"week 4\".</p>\n   \n\n    <Link to=\"/\">Go back to the homepage</Link>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport const query = graphql`\n  query {\n    file(relativePath: { eq: \"WS03/WS3dependencies.png\" }) {\n      childImageSharp {\n        fluid(maxWidth: 800) {\n            ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }`\n\nexport default Workshop07\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
